## Project # 1: 	Measure/Observe

In this section of the class, we will get to know measure as a product and producer of human experience. We will measure our environment in relation to ourselves individually and collectively.  We will use ourselves at the primary unit of measure to reflect on the uses and designed intentions of our surroundings. Project: Orchestrate and verbally direct your fellow students in the measuring of a site or situation you wish to investigate utilizing objects and class members as units of measure. Direct me on how to document your act of measurement. You may choose any site within a 20 minute walk of the Corcoran. If we can’t reach the site, how might you bring it to us? (think of some of the examples from my presentation)

OR

Take video of how people react to pathways or architectural features of structures. You will collect these observations and edit them into a 5 minute presentation that shows us how crowds, structures, solitude, convenience, pace, energy, acoustics, affect the way people navigate and interact with structures.

## Homework:

- Readings: found in the "examples folder" at the top of this page. That will take you to a Github page where you can download the zip folder of readings
- As you move around the city over the next week, observe. Explore. Look. Listen. How will you approach project 1? keep a journal of your observations, ideas, inspirations. Next week, you will do field work to write your instructions, draw your map, make your measurements. I will be available to help with documentation and ideation via a google signup that will open at the beginning of class next week.

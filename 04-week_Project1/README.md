## Group Reading Assignment

Each group is going to read a section from the first chapter from __The Design of Everyday Things__

Group 1: 1-10
Group 2: 10-23
Group 3: 23-31
Group 4: 31-36

After you have ready your section fully, come together (or work together in a google chat or google doc) to distill one big idea per page. Feel free to use an important quote from that page as support for the big idea. Write this down in the shared document in our class folder called "Group Reading Synopsis". You will present your section to the class next week, so be ready to elaborate on what you gathered (use images or examples to support if needed). Please practice and keep this between 5-7 minutes.  

## Homework:

- Turn in Measure/Observe documentation
- Reading and group synopsis

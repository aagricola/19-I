## COURSE DESCRIPTION
How to understand, conceptualize, and create art and design projects that expect interaction from audiences or users. How design influences the way we navigate the world; politics of space; skills for working collaboratively with other makers.

## Important Things to Remember
 - Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
 - Participation is integral to this class's culture. This also means coming prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
 -  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
 - You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.

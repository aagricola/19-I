## Project 4

Will explore the possibilities of designing and building a collective structure out of smaller, designed units. Collectively, we will devise an overall form. Then, with 1-2 partners, you will design and build a structurally sound unit that can accommodate all members of your group as you perform a task or function of daily living (your choice). In addition to accommodating your task, you will work with the other groups in the class to build points of connection, pass through, or communication between your units. We will explore a range of animal-, insect- and human-built structures that grow by a combination of planned design and ad hoc customization.

During the Critique, the class will present artist/designer talks. With your partner(s), you will present your research, work process, and final installation decisions in a 10-15 minute artist talk in the gallery.

Complete your project by documenting your unit and its function.

# Week 9: Intro to Electronics!

## Today:

- Artist Visit with Robin Bell
- Quick round robin about the reading
- Intro to Arduino
  - Pack your Metros back up for returning
    - I am so so sorry for this inconvenience
  - Blink an LED
  - Use a button to turn on LED
  - Analog input & output

## Setup

Last week we had trouble finding the Metro because we had not installed the proper drivers for it to be recognized by the ports on our computers. Please follow the instructions linked below for your operating system.

## Arduino

[Intro to Arduino - Digital Signal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSGg1m6meaZMJcCXPn2bYvBKKzyEVN_cak2hm9wtn7438EMypZ_Jv_abR7Gc86oUmkc73jENSX0m2KH/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

## Project 3

Using any combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design an interface that disrupts, corrects or comments on a technology, social system, cultural algorithm, or codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale in our world/society.

"Critical design is one of the most promising and far-reaching new areas of study, using conceptual scenarios built around hypothetical objects to comment on the social, political, and cultural consequences of new technologies and behaviors. Its disciples are experts in "what if?" - Paola Antonelli

Think of this project in terms of critical design as Paola Antonelli describes it in "Talk to Me". Address your relationship to a thing, situation, social or cultural scenario that is at odds with the way you would like the world to be and design a hypothetical object that corrects it or at least allows an experience of or understanding of an alternative. Think about the physical interface and installation of the work. How might you invite interaction into your creation? Reflect back to ways Rafael Lozano Hemmer used signifiers to connote affordances in his works.

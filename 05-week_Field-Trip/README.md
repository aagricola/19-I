# Week 5: Field Trip to Hirshhorn

## Today:

- Visit Rafael Lozano-Hemmer exhibit
  - Discuss and apply principles from the reading
- Museum study
  - 5:25 meet back in the lobby
- "In Class" Assignment

## Museum Study

As you go enjoy the rest of the museum, pick one piece and write a paragraph about it. (It could be from the Lozano-Hemmer exhibit if you choose.) How is it engaging you. Does the space surrounding the work support your engagement with it? Explain how (or how it does not). Take photos to support your statement(s). When you get to your computer, please share your findings in the shared google drive folder on the document called "Museum Study".

## Design of Everyday Things Assignment

Find something from your everyday surroundings that is effectively communicating how it works. Write about:
- What are itâ€™s affordances?
- Signifiers?
- Constraints?
- Mappings?
- Feedback?

Find something that is not well designed or communicated effectively and explain why.
- What could you do to help it communicate or function more effectively?
- Draw a sign or a solution for it using vector based tools in Illustrator. We will work with these next week in our laser cutting workshop.
- Be ready to share this with the class next week.

## Group Reading Assignment

Each group is going to read a section from the second chapter of __The Design of Everyday Things__

- Group 4: 37-44
- Group 3: 44-52
- Group 2: 53-63
- Group 1: 63-73

After you have read your section fully, work together in the google doc to distill one big idea per page. Feel free to use an important quote from that page as support for the big idea or to ask a question. Write this down in [this shared document in our class folder called "Group Reading Synopsis 2"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmNsg34jqr2IzgAZenIsk2onUqqwqFBUZLxI8YdGH7o/edit#). We will discuss the reading in its entirety next week, so be ready to elaborate on what you wrote.

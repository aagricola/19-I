## Project 2: Call to Action (Due March 6)

**Last week's assignment got you started on the research presentation part of Project 2:**

Find something from your everyday surroundings that is effectively communicating how it works. Write about:
- What are its affordances?
- Signifiers?
- Constraints?
- Mappings?
- Feedback?
- Evaluate your levels of processing with it and its calls to action

Find something from your everyday surroundings that is not well designed or communicating effectively and explain why. Use the above questions again.
- What could you do to help it communicate or function more effectively? (Make a sketch of this)
- Summarize your research into a 5 minute presentation that will be presented on the day of critique for  Project 2 (March 6)

**Project 2 Description**

In this section of the course we have explored how designed objects and spaces make demands of us to interact in specific ways.  And we have investigated ways they ask us to recall behaviors we already know how to perform.  Project 2: You will begin by documenting scenarios and calls to action initiated by designed objects and spaces you find in your surroundings. Summarize your research in a presentation to the class (five-minutes). Then, you will create a tool for solving an every day problem in an unexpected way. The tool should interface with the body as a sort of prosthesis. You can use found objects from your everyday environment as well as fabricated objects. These designs can be as speculative or pragmatic as you wish. Complete the project by documenting your tool and interaction.

## Project 2 Inspiration

**When you view a normal routine in life as a performance, this can be basic research" - Alan Kaprow**

The following examples for Project 2 start with the most speculative and end in most pragmatic.

"Pencil Mask", 1972

"Pencil mask" substitutes the head for the hand, turning the face into a drawing instrument. Touch and site are now intermingled.

"Finger Gloves", 1972

"Finger Gloves" are prosthetic extenders that deny the hand intimacy and enable more remote touch.

Expression Dispatcher, 2009

Gerard Rallo has made a series of communication Devices. Expressions Dispatcher is designed to help people in their quest for expressiveness. In using the device we can shift expressive responsibility and place it in the hands of an expert. [Visit his full website](http://www.gerardrallo.net/#art_design)

"Conduit", 2009

"Conuit ritualises the daily act of urinating by altering the physicality of the activity. Antoni provides women a tool for peeing while standing... She is pictured here urinating off the Chrysler Building, one of the great symbols of New York and the primacy of the phallocentric in architecture." - Madeline Schwartzman

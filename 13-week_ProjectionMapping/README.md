  - Learn to use Mad Mapper
  - Map animations
- Discuss Reading
- Project 4 introduction and ideation

## Project 4

Will explore the possibilities of designing and building a collective structure out of smaller, designed units. Collectively, we will devise an overall form. Then, with 1-2 partners, you will design and build a structurally sound unit that can accommodate all members of your group as you perform a task or function of daily living (your choice). In addition to accommodating your task, you will work with the other groups in the class to build points of connection, pass through, or communication between your units. We will explore a range of animal-, insect- and human-built structures that grow by a combination of planned design and ad hoc customization.

During the Critique, the class will present artist/designer talks. With your partner(s), you will present your research, work process, and final installation decisions in a 10-15 minute artist talk in the gallery.

Complete your project by documenting your unit and its function.

Technology has helped set new condition for perception and society which calls us to rethink the body.
- post-Humanity
- technology as body prosthetic
- media as extension of itself

Art participate in this discussion by using electronic and digital technologies in experiments aimed to unsettle the audience's perceptual habits and social behaviors

Development of projecting techniques since the 80s has made it possible to vary the appearance of the image and the involvement of the viewer.

## Basic Electronics

[Leah Buechley Video here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9j8DIHXSKA?ecver=1)
Leah Buechley is a designer, engineer, and educator whose work explores intersections and juxtapositions–of “high” and “low” technologies, new and ancient materials, and masculine and feminine making traditions. she also is the inventor of the lillypad (arduino board for sewn electronics)!

Simple Circuits:

## Project 3

Using any combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a system that disrupts, corrects or comments on a technology, social system, cultural algorithm, or codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale in our world/society.

"Critical design is one of the most promising and far-reaching new areas of study, using conceptual scenarios built around hypothetical objects to comment on the social, political, and cultural consequences of new technologies and behaviors. Its disciples are experts in "what if?" - Paola Antonelli

Think of this project in terms of critical design as Paola Antonelli describes it in "Talk to Me". Address your relationship to a thing, situation, social or cultural scenario that is at odds with the way you would like the world to be and design a hypothetical object that corrects it or at least allows an experience of or understanding of an alternative. Think about the physical interface and installation of the work. How might you invite interaction into your creation? Reflect back to ways Rafael Lozano Hemmer used signifiers to connote affordances in his works.

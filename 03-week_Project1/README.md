### Liz Ogbu
"[Liz Ogbu](https://www.ted.com/talks/liz_ogbu_what_if_gentrification_was_about_healing_communities_instead_of_displacing_them?language=en#t-884050) is an architect who works on spatial justice: the idea that justice has a georgaphy and that the equitable distribution of resources and services is a human right."

### Soil Series

"[SOIL SERIES: A Social Drawing](https://soilseriesbethel.com/author/soilseriesbethel/) is a collaborative work of art and an ongoing conversation between artists Francesca Fiore and Hillary Wagner and the rural Appalachian community of Bethel, OH. A dynamic set of relationships between artists, community members, and local organizations, SOIL SERIES is a drawing in the most expansive sense. As it creates the conditions for new conversations and relationships within the community and without, each new connection becomes a dynamic line in a relational web. This relational web, or social drawing, is the generative engine for community-initiated social change."

### Trees of Tomorrow

"[Trees of Tomorrow](http://www.treesoftomorrow.life/) is walking tour, research-based inquiry, community art project, and roving speculative workstation. Rooted in Flushing, Queens, the location of the first commercial nurseries of the colonies, Trees of Tomorrow tracks the suspicious concurrence of globalized natures with trees as decoration, with trees as unpaid laborers. Walking routes, archival images, traces of ongoing investigations into the histories and possible naturecultures for urban trees — are presented here."

[Bad at Sports podcast](https://soilseriesbethel.com/2018/06/24/soil-series-on-bad-at-sports-podcast/) has a reeeeeeally great interview with the above two groups. Give it a listen to learn more.

### Spiral Jetty

![Spiral Jetty](https://www.diaart.org/media/w1050h700/object/smi-spiraljetty-steinmetz.jpg)

Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty, located at Rozel Point on the northeastern shore of Great Salt Lake in Utah. "In 1970, assisted by a crew operating dump trucks, a tractor, and a front loader, Smithson displaced some 6,000 tons of black basalt rock and earth from the adjacent shore to form a coil 1,500 feet long and approximately 15 feet wide, winding counterclockwise into the lake. Created at a time when water levels were particularly low, Spiral Jetty was submerged in 1972. Droughts caused the lake to recede in 2002, and the sculpture has remained visible ever since.

'I like landscapes that suggest prehistory,' Smithson once observed. The site of Spiral Jetty was chosen by the artist for the lake’s unusual ecological and geological properties. The reddish coloration of the water, caused by the high presence of microbes, initially attracted Smithson to the north arm of the lake. The spiral shape alludes to the molecular lattice of the salt-crystal deposits found throughout the lake’s expanse, and in forming the work, he chose to use basalt boulders of hardened lava found along the peninsula, scattered remnants of the now extinct volcanos in the area.

The fractured landscape, fluctuating water levels, and the water’s salinity also speak of the artist’s preoccupation with the concept of entropy. Smithson envisioned an artwork in a state of constant transformation whose form is never fixed and undergoes decay from the moment of its creation. His thinking was equally shaped by his understanding of the third law of thermodynamics as well as a fascination in science fiction and popular science."

## Project # 1: 	Measure/Observe

In this section of the class, we will get to know measure as a product and producer of human experience. We will measure our environment in relation to ourselves individually and collectively.  We will use ourselves as the primary unit of measure to reflect on the uses and designed intentions of our surroundings. Project: Orchestrate and verbally direct your fellow students in the measuring of a site or situation you wish to investigate utilizing objects and class members as units of measure. You will be the director of your act of measurement. You will also document your measurement for the critique or you may choose any site within a 20 minute walk of the Corcoran and we can go to experience the act in person. If we can’t reach the site, how might you bring it to us?

OR

Take video of how people react to pathways or architectural features of structures. You will collect these observations and edit them into a 5 minute video and/or presentation that shows us how crowds, structures, solitude, convenience, pace, energy, acoustics, affect the way people navigate and interact with structures.

## Homework:

- Finish your Measure/Observe project and be ready to present it to the class for a critique next week
- **Optional**: Listen to [Soil Series podcast](https://soilseriesbethel.com/2018/06/24/soil-series-on-bad-at-sports-podcast/)

# Week 6: SNOW DAY!!!

## Today:

- Review Readings
- Go through Illustrator together
  - design a simple 2"x2" thing to cut on the laser cutter
- Laser cutting workshop
- Work on Project 2
  - One-on-one meetings

## Illustrator & Laser Cutter Assignment

Download the examples in today's folder. Work in the Illustrator template. Create a simple shape no more than 2" x 2" using a red outline; this shape is to be cut out. Inside that shape, using the blue outline, create a design to be vector engraved (this will not be cut all the way through). Using black fill, write something using the text tool that will be raster engraved.

Partner up with someone to help each other cut these out using the laser cutter (because two heads are always better than one!). Return to the quick-start manual in today's folder or ask me questions as needed. 

## Project 2: Call to Action (Due March 6)

In this section of the course we have explored how designed objects and spaces make demands of us to interact in specific ways.  And we have investigated ways they ask us to recall behaviors we already know how to perform.  Project 2: You will begin by documenting scenarios and calls to action initiated by designed objects and spaces you find in your surroundings (this part is what you did for last weeks assignment). Summarize your research in a presentation to the class (five-minutes). Then, you will create a tool for solving an every day problem in an unexpected way. The tool should interface with the body as a sort of prosthesis. You can use found objects from your everyday environment as well as fabricated objects. These designs can be as speculative or pragmatic as you wish. Complete the project by documenting your tool and interaction.
